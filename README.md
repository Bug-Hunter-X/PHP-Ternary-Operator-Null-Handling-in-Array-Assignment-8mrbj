This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in PHP: unexpected behavior of the ternary operator when used within array assignments, particularly when dealing with null or empty values from user input (e.g., from `$_POST`). The example shows how this can lead to unexpected warnings or errors if not handled correctly. The solution illustrates how to efficiently and safely address this issue to prevent runtime problems and enhance code robustness.
