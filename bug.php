This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator within an array assignment.  The issue arises from PHP's loose typing and its handling of empty strings and null values. 

```php
$data = ['name' => isset($_POST['name']) ? $_POST['name'] : null, 'age' => isset($_POST['age']) ? (int)$_POST['age'] : null];

//Attempting to access elements which might be null without checking can result in errors
echo $data['name'] . " is ". $data['age'] . " years old";
```

In this scenario, if either `$_POST['name']` or `$_POST['age']` is not set, the corresponding array element will be assigned `null`. While this is usually acceptable, directly concatenating `null` with strings leads to a warning. Additionally, accessing a non-existent array element results in a notice or error, depending on PHP settings.
